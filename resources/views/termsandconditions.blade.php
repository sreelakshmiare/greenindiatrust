					<p class="text-justify text-success"><strong>(A) Green India Services Description</strong><br/>
					Green India trust is an NGO registered under Societies Act 21, 1860. It aims to create greenery
					 on Earth with the contribution from corporate organizations, their employees, individuals,
					  environmental agencies and funding entities.GIT gives its users an opportunity to select a 
					  site from listed options to plant trees. We use internet and associated information technology 
					  enabled processes to ensure transparency and visibility. We issue a certificate as a token of 
					  appreciation to planters and also post the same on social networks if the user opts for the same. 
					  In lieu of our services following points should be noted: 
					</p>

					<ol class = "orderlist text-success">	
						<li class="text-success">GIT runs the tree plantation and rural livelihood program in association with our NGO partners. 
						We follow a strict due diligence process to select sites for plantation and we do a detailed scrutiny 
						in order to select NGO partner to be responsible for carrying out the plantation in selected locations.</li>
						<li class="text-success">We leverage services from various environmental agencies and independent experts to select plant species.</li>
						<li class="text-success">GIT and its affiliates (including our NGO partners) adopt best practices to plant trees and make best efforts 
						to maintain trees post plantation. However, GIT shall not be responsible for any harm to planted trees which may occur due to reasons 
						beyond our control (fire, flood, earthquake, drought, diseases and land acquisition by government authorities). 
						We also enforce fencing and protection mechanism to ensure planted trees are intact and safe however GIT shall not be responsible for the harm occurring from illegal felling or grazing of trees</li>
						<li class="text-success">Sometimes it may be possible that we may tag already planted tree to your virtual tree. This is done only under the circumstances wherein we feel that actual plantation is not possible 
						due to unforeseen conditions. We maintain a separate lot to meet the aforementioned eventuality. 
						However, GIT never tags trees which have already been tagged to other planters</li>
						<li class="text-success"> As soon as a virtual tree is planted on GIT portal, we arrange for
						 plantation of the real tree at the location chosen by the planter. However whenever weather conditions do
						  not allow timely plantation there might be a delay in plantation (to a maximum extent of one year) and
						   GIT will notify planters about the delay. Subject to weather conditions there might be change in location 
						   of actual tree plantation, GIT however will notify about the actual location of plantation.</li>
						<li class="text-success">Wherever contributors/planters are interested to visit plantation sites 
						they are encouraged to do so on their own expenses.</li>
						<li class="text-success">GIT follows strict audit processes to track post plantation growth and survival of planted trees, it also plants extra number of trees (buffer trees) to minimize effect of mortality rate that might occur due to unavoidable circumstances or reasons mentioned earlier. We have implemented best technology system to track and map individual trees however
						 there might be minor deviation due to unavailability of GPS signals at few places/under few weather conditions</li>
						<li class="text-success">Planters do not own trees or any products derived from the trees planted by them.</li>
					</ol>
					<p class="text-justify text-success">“We as a merchant shall be under no liability whatsoever in respect of any loss or damage arising directly or indirectly out 
					of the decline of authorization for any Transaction, on Account of the Cardholder having exceeded the preset limit mutually 
					agreed by us with our acquiring bank from time to time”. 	</p>

					 	Few of these components are pending for patent; therefore, 
						adherence to our user license policy is of utmost importance.</p>
