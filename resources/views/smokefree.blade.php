					 <p class="text-justify text-success">Cigarettes contain about 600 ingredients, many of which can also be found in cigars and hookahs. When these ingredients burn, they generate more than 7,000 chemicals, according to the American Lung Association. Many of those chemicals are poisonous and at least 69 of them are linked to cancer.
					 </p>

					 <p class="text-justify text-success">In the United States, the mortality rate for smokers is three times that of people who never smoked. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say that smoking is the most common "preventable cause of death" in the United States. While the effects of smoking may not be immediate, the complications and damage can last for years. The good news is that quitting smoking can reverse many effects.

					 <h4 class="text-justify text-success">Central Nervous System:</h4>
					 	
						 <p class="text-justify text-success">One of the ingredients in tobacco is a mood-altering drug called nicotine. <b>Nicotine </b>reaches your brain in mere seconds and makes you feel more energized for a while. But as that effect wears off, you feel tired and crave more. Nicotine is extremely habit-forming, which is why people find smoking <b>so difficult to quit</b>. Physical withdrawal from nicotine can impair your cognitive functioning and make you feel anxious, irritated, and depressed. Withdrawal can also cause headaches and sleep problems.

							 <h4 class="text-justify text-success">Respiratory System:</h4>
							 <p class="text-justify text-success">When you inhale smoke, you are taking in substances that can damage your lungs. Over time, this damage leads to a variety of problems. Along with increased infections, people who smoke are at higher risk for chronic nonreversible lung conditions such as:

		 <p class="text-justify text-success">Withdrawal from tobacco products can cause temporary congestion and respiratory discomfort as your lungs and airways begin to heal. Increased mucus production right after quitting smoking is a positive sign that your respiratory system is recovering. Children whose parents smoke are more prone to coughing, wheezing, and asthma attacks than children whose parents don't. They also tend to have higher rates of <b><u>pneumonia and bronchitis. </u></b>
		 </p>
		
		<h4 class="text-justify text-success">Cardiovascular System:</h4>
		  <p class="text-justify text-success">Smoking damages your entire cardiovascular system. Nicotine causes blood vessels to tighten, which restricts the flow of blood. Over time, the ongoing narrowing, along with damage to the blood vessels, can cause disease. Smoking also raises blood pressure, weakens blood vessel walls, and increases <b>blood clots</b>. Together, this raises your risk of <b>stroke</b>.
			You are also at an increased risk of worsening heart disease if you have already had <b>heart bypass surgery, a heart attack</b>, or a <b>stent</b> placed in a blood vessel.<br/>
			Smoking not only impacts your cardiovascular health, but also the health of those around you who don't smoke. Exposure to secondhand smoke carries the same risk to a nonsmoker as someone who does smoke. Risks include stroke, heart attack, and <b>heart disease</b>.

					<h4 class="text-justify text-success">Digestive System:</h4>
					<p class="text-justify text-success">Smoking increases the risk of mouth, throat, larynx, and esophagus cancer. Smokers also have higher rates of pancreatic cancer. Even people who “smoke but don’t inhale” face an increased risk of mouth cancer.
					Smoking also has an effect on insulin, making it more likely that you’ll develop insulin resistance. That puts you at increased risk of type 2 diabetes and its complications, which tend to develop at a faster rate than in people who don’t smoke.
